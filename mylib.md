# Games That Shaped Me

Games have been the most influential creative medium in my life. What drew me in wasn’t just fun or spectacle—it was the way games build *living systems*: worlds built with an emphasis on player choice, dynamic environments, and interactive experiences.

Many of the titles below introduced me to subjects like fantasy, history, science, and much more. Some helped me through formative years, others sparked friendships, and many still influence how I think about game design today. More than nostalgia, this library represents the foundations of how I approach **interactivity, narrative, and systems-driven design** as a developer.

This is only a snapshot—but it captures a glimpse of some of the experiences that pushed me toward making games of my own.
