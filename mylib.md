# Games That Shaped Me

Video games have been the most impactful form of media in my life. While I loved books as a kid, the moment I discovered how expansive and immersive games could be (~20 years ago), I was hooked. A great game doesn’t just tell a story — it builds a living, interactive world filled with choices, challenges, and meaning.

Many of the titles below introduced me to fantasy, historical themes, scientific ideas, and philosophical questions. Many of them were just fun! Some of them helped me through common life struggles, gave me common ground to form friendships, and shaped my outlook on life. More than anything, they inspired me to pursue game development — to create the kinds of games with dynamic storytelling that had such a profound impact on me growing up, and to provide that experience for someone else.

This list contains just some of those games that I grew up with, played through different generations, and that I may even revisit from time to time.
