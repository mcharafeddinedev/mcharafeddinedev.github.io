## 🕹️ Games
### Games That Shaped Me

Video games have been the most impactful form of media in my life. While I loved books as a kid, the moment I discovered how expansive and immersive games could be, I was hooked. A great game doesn’t just tell a story — it builds a living, interactive world filled with choices, challenges, and meaning. Many of the titles below introduced me to historical themes, scientific ideas, and philosophical questions. They significantly helped me through common life struggles, gave me a common ground with others to create conversation and form friendships, and contributed to shaping my outlook on life. More than anything, looking back on all of them, they’re what inspired me to pursue game development — to create the kinds of games and stories with dynamic interactivity that had such a profound impact on me growing up, and then provide that experience for someone else.

This list contains some of the games that I grew up with, played through different generations, and that I may even revisit from time to time.

This list is a just snapshot of the games off the top of my head or that I still have hard copies of, that not only entertained me growing up but contributed in part to shaping how I think and feel about interactivity, narrative, and creative expression. These experiences laid the foundations for why I’m pursuing game development today.
