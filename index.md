Hey there! I’m Marwan, a game programmer and developer passionate about creating immersive experiences and engaging gameplay. I work primarily with Unity and Unreal Engine, focusing on gameplay programming and building systems that make games come alive.

I discovered game development a couple of years after completing my veterinary studies at Texas A&M. While I enjoyed studying the life sciences, I realized my true passion was in designing and building interactive worlds. My science background helps me approach game systems with logic, precision, and problem-solving skills—whether it’s debugging complex mechanics, scripting AI behaviors, or refining technical features.

Here, I share my projects, technical breakdowns, and development insights. I hope this portfolio reflects both my skill and enthusiasm for game development, and my dedication to learning, improving, and contributing to meaningful projects.

Take a look around—and if you’d like to connect, I’d love to hear from you!
