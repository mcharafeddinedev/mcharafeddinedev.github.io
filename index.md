Hey there!
I’m Marwan, a game programmer and developer passionate about creating immersive experiences and engaging gameplay. Whether it’s building complex systems in Unreal Engine 5 and Unity, scripting AI behaviors, or crafting dynamic environments, I enjoy tackling the challenges that make games come alive.

Here, I share my projects, technical breakdowns, and development insights. Take a look around—and if you’d like to connect, I’d love to hear from you!
