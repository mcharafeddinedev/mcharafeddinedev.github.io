# Welcome to my website!


Hey there! I'm Marwan, a games programmer and developer. I'm passionate about building immersive experiences and gameplay mechanics. Whether itâ€™s setting up complex systems in Unreal Engine 5 and Unity, scripting AI behaviors, or crafting dynamic environments, I love solving the challenges that bring games to life.

This website is a collection of my projects, technical breakdowns, and development insights.
Take a look around, and feel free to reach out!
