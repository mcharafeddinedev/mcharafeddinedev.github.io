# Gameplay Programmer · Systems Design

Hey — I'm Marwan, a gameplay programmer focused on building responsive mechanics, scalable systems, and immersive player experiences.

I work primarily in **Unreal Engine** and **Unity**, specializing in gameplay scripting, level prototyping, and building technical systems that support strong moment-to-moment play. My background in science sharpened my problem-solving mindset, which I now apply to debugging, feature development, and game systems architecture.

This site highlights my projects, experiments, and ongoing work. For deeper technical breakdowns, check out my GitHub or reach out anytime.

## What I Do

- **Gameplay Programming** — player controllers, input handling, camera behavior, triggers, core mechanics
- **Systems Design** — ability systems, state machines, inventory/item logic, save/load, game loops
- **Technical Work** — debugging features, profiling performance, staying current with emerging tools and development practices
- **Engine Experience** — Unity (C#), Unreal Engine (C++ & Blueprints), comfortable in both rapid prototyping and longer production cycles, small-scale level design & building
- **Collaboration** — working with designers and artists to implement features that match creative intent
