# Current Pursuits

As I near the completion of my A.A.S. in Digital Gaming & Simulation Programming, my focus has shifted from coursework toward building long-term technical depth as a gameplay programmer and software engineer. My education laid a solid foundation, but my priority now is hands-on development: writing systems, refining architecture, improving workflows, and strengthening my fluency in code.

---

## Active Work

### Gameplay Systems & Prototyping

Currently developing an **endless-runner style arcade game** focused on responsive movement, state-driven mechanics, scoring systems, and replayable game loops. The project serves as a controlled environment for refining gameplay logic, modular systems, and moment-to-moment feel without unnecessary complexity.

### Engine-Level Exploration (C++)

Experimenting with creating a **custom 2D engine in C++**. While not yet production-ready, this work has strengthened my understanding of rendering fundamentals, entity management, and low-level architecture. I plan to revisit and expand this project as my C++ proficiency continues to grow.

### Tooling & Modern Workflows

While my primary focus is gameplay programming, I take a strong interest in lower-level computer science—how engines are structured, how systems interact, and how graphics are rendered. I actively explore **editor tooling and development automation**, including Python-based workflows for Unreal Engine tasks, data handling, and internal utilities.

## Learning Track

I use **guided, project-based courses** as deliberate practice—reinforcing fundamentals while applying them directly to real builds. When a project reaches polish or produces a viable executable, it moves to [Projects](projects.md).

### Current & Planned Study

These courses support ongoing development in C++, C#, gameplay programming, and engine workflows:

- **Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D** — Unity, C#, gameplay systems
- **Unity 2D Roguelike** — Architecture, stat systems, UI, OOP
- **C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming** — Core C++, Raylib, 2D games
- **Learn C++ for Game Development** — Language foundations, structured labs
- **Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer** — Gameplay systems, AI, C++/Blueprint integration

---

## Long-Term Direction

My goal is to grow as a **gameplay programmer with strong systems and technical foundations**—someone comfortable working across engines, codebases, and tools while maintaining a player-first design mindset.

That means continuing to:

- Build focused gameplay systems and small, complete prototypes  
- Deepen C++ knowledge and low-level architecture skills  
- Refine workflows through tooling and automation  
- Stay adaptable as development practices evolve
