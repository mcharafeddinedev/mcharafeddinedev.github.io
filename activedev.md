# Current Pursuits

As I near the completion of my A.A.S. in Digital Gaming & Simulation (for Programmers)—a generalist program covering programming, technical art, design, and production workflows—my focus has shifted toward building deeper technical depth as a gameplay programmer. While my education provided a broad foundation across disciplines, my priority now is hands-on development: writing systems, refining architecture, and strengthening my fluency in code.

---

## Skills & Expertise

**Core Development**
- **Gameplay Programming** — player controllers, input handling, camera behavior, physics-based mechanics, movement systems, enemy AI, combat systems, interactive triggers, data assets, UI/HUD integration
- **Systems Design** — ability systems, state machines, inventory/item logic, upgrade frameworks, save/load systems, game loops, procedural generation, data-driven architecture, modular systems that scale

**Technical Skills**
- **Engine Experience** — Unity (C#), Unreal Engine (C++ & Blueprints), comfortable in both rapid prototyping and longer production cycles, small-scale level design & building
- **Technical Work** — debugging features, profiling performance, staying current with emerging tools and development practices

**Collaboration & QA**
- **Collaboration** — working with designers and artists to implement features that match creative intent, working with other programmers on the same features
- **QA Mindset** — rigorous playtesting, clear bug documentation, and a deep player perspective built on 25+ years of gaming across genres, platforms, and eras, both competitively and casually

## Most Recent/Active Work

**OVERCLOCKED: Data Dash MAX** — Released a complete C++ arcade endless runner for PC and arcade cabinet hardware. Built with component-based architecture, 45+ obstacle patterns, data-driven theming, local leaderboards, and full input support. See [Projects](projects) or [play it on Itch.io](https://goldleafinteractive.itch.io/overclocked-ddm).

**Breathe** — Building a breath-controlled sailboat race in Unity with custom breath-sensing hardware and a source-agnostic input layer (hardware, microphone fallback, simulated). Breath is the only input; no-fail design with AI companions and a celebration-focused finish. Prototype phase—vertical slice in progress. [Repo & docs](https://github.com/mcharafeddinedev/Breathe-Game).

**Engine-Level Exploration (C++)** — Experimenting with a custom 2D engine in C++ to strengthen understanding of rendering fundamentals, entity management, and low-level architecture.

**Tooling & Modern Workflows** — Exploring editor tooling and development automation, including Python-based workflows for Unreal Engine tasks and data handling.

## Learning Track

I use **guided, project-based courses** as deliberate practice—reinforcing fundamentals while applying them directly to real builds. When a project reaches polish or produces a viable executable, it moves to [Projects](projects).

**Unreal Engine & C++** — UE5 C++ development, C++ fundamentals with Raylib, game development foundations, low-level engine concepts, and project-based C++ through interactive builds.

**Unity & C#** — Complete Unity 3D development pipeline (C# scripting, physics, AI, UI, publishing) and 2D roguelike architecture with procedural systems.

## Player Perspective & QA

I bring a **deep player perspective** shaped by decades of gaming experience across platforms, genres, and eras. This background directly informs my work:

- **Playtesting** — Rigorous testing with iterative adjustments, catching edge cases and feel issues before they compound
- **Game Feel** — Intuition for when mechanics feel "off"—input lag, movement weight, damage numbers, or progression pacing
- **Player Connection** — Thinking like a player first helps anticipate friction points and balance concerns
- **Documentation** — Clear, organized reporting for bug tracking, design specs, and team communication

My generalist foundation (programming, art pipelines, design, technical workflows) combined with extensive playtesting experience helps me understand what QA teams look for: things like edge cases, balance issues, and player friction points.

## Long-Term Direction

My goal is to keep learning and growing as a **gameplay programmer with strong systems and technical foundations**—building core features & mechanics across engines, codebases, and tools while maintaining a player-first design mindset. That means continuing to build clean, scalable systems, go deeper on C++ and engine internals, stay sharp on evolving tools, and ALWAYS playtest early with iterative feedback.
