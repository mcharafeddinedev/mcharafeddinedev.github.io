# Current Pursuits & Goals

As I near the completion of my A.A.S. in Digital Gaming & Simulation Programming, my focus has shifted from coursework toward building long-term technical depth as a gameplay programmer and software engineer. My education laid a solid foundation, but my priority now is hands-on development: writing systems, refining architecture, improving workflows, and strengthening my fluency in code.

This page outlines what I’m actively working on, the technical directions I’m developing in, and the structured learning I use to reinforce those efforts.

## What I’m Working On Now

### 🎮 Gameplay Systems & Prototyping  
I’m currently (January 2026) developing an **endless-runner style arcade game** focused on responsive movement, state-driven mechanics, scoring systems, and replayable game loops. The project serves as a controlled environment for refining gameplay logic, modular systems, and moment-to-moment feel without unnecessary complexity.

---

### ⚙️ Engine-Level Exploration (C++)  
Alongside engine-based development, I’ve been experimenting with creating a **custom 2D engine in C++**. While not yet production-ready, this work has strengthened my understanding of rendering fundamentals, entity management, and low-level architecture. I plan to revisit and expand this project in a more structured way as my C++ proficiency continues to grow.

---

### 🧩 Tooling, Automation & Modern Workflows  
While my primary focus is gameplay programming and game development, I also take a strong interest in lower-level computer science—how engines are structured, how systems interact, and how graphics are rendered. I actively explore **editor tooling and development automation**, including Python-based workflows for Unreal Engine tasks, data handling, and internal utilities. More broadly, I stay current with emerging technologies and workflow techniques, integrating them into my projects to improve iteration speed, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

## Learning & Skill Development  

Rather than treating learning as a checklist, I use **guided, project-based courses** as deliberate practice—reinforcing fundamentals while applying them directly to real builds. When a project reaches a level of polish or produces a viable executable, it’s moved to **[My Projects](projects.md)** as either a playable release or a documented prototype.


### 📚 Current & Planned Study (Udemy)

These courses support my ongoing development in C++, C#, gameplay programming, and engine workflows:

1. **Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D** – Unity, C#, gameplay systems

8. **Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer** – Gameplay systems, AI, C++/Blueprint integration  
   https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/

These are part of a long-term learning track that I revisit as time allows, with an emphasis on applying concepts directly in projects rather than completing coursework in isolation.

## Long-Term Direction

My goal is to grow as a **gameplay programmer with strong systems and technical foundations**—someone comfortable working across engines, codebases, and tools while maintaining a player-first design mindset.

That means continuing to:
- Build focused gameplay systems and small, complete prototypes  
- Deepen C++ knowledge and low-level architecture skills  
- Refine workflows through tooling and automation  
- Stay adaptable as development practices and technologies evolve  

This page will continue to evolve as projects mature and new directions take shape.
