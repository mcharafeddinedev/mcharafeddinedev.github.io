# Current Pursuits & Goals

As I've progressed through my A.A.S. in Digital Gaming & Simulation Programming, Iâ€™ve realized that while my education has laid a solid foundation, I still need more hands-on experience and fluency in coding to reach my goals as a gameplay programmer. To address this, Iâ€™ve committed to a structured, self-teaching plan focused on intensive, project-based courses â€” not arbitrary YouTube-style tutorials, but rather more guided experiences with deliberate and professional frameworks, designed to simulate practical game development and production workflows.

Some of these projects revisit foundational topics Iâ€™ve already encountered during my degree, but I believe strongly in the value of reviewing the basics. On top of that, these projects are specifically code-focused rather than concentrating on things like design processes or game engine techniques, tools, proficiency, etc. In a fast-evolving tech industry like game development, I think keeping skills sharp and perspective broad is essential, so I'll probably continue adding to this and editing it, and moving completed projects to ['My Projects'](projects.md) if they produce a publishable executable. Advanced systems often demand a deep understanding of fundamentals, and Iâ€™m choosing to start this code-focused path from the ground up.

Below is an evolving record of the work Iâ€™m doing, organized by current and planned projects.

## Under Active Development

### 1. Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D (Unity 6 Update)
**Instructors:** Rick Davidson, GameDev.tv Team, Stephen Hubbard  
ðŸ”— [View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/)  
**Skill Focus:** Unity 3D fundamentals, C# scripting, procedural generation, AI navigation, FPS mechanics

A full-spectrum learning path through Unity 3D development, this project track involves building five complete games using C# in Unity. These include physics-based obstacle dodging, an arcade-style rail shooter, a procedural endless runner, and a first-person shooter using nav mesh AI. Through these projects, Iâ€™m mastering player input handling, prefab architecture, physics interactions, coroutine timing systems, and level prototyping with ProBuilder â€” all while reinforcing C# fundamentals in a production environment.

### 2. Unity 2D Roguelike â€“ Kawaii Survivor
**Instructor:** Tabsil Makes Games  
ðŸ”— [View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-2d-game-kawaii-survivor-the-coolest-roguelike-ever/)  
**Skill Focus:** Stat systems, clean code architecture, UI/UX animation, OOP in Unity, wave spawning

This project focuses on building a Vampire Survivors-style roguelike from the ground up in Unity 2D, with a strong emphasis on scalable architecture and object-oriented practices. It incorporates responsive joystick controls, weapon merging systems, runtime character stats, inventory UI, and custom wave-based enemy spawns. I'm also learning to build clean, modular code using inheritance, interfaces, and scriptable objects, while integrating advanced UI elements such as animated double-sliding panels, dynamic character selection, and multiple currencies.

## Future Planned Projects

### 3. C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners
**Instructors:** GameDev.tv Team, Stephen Ulibarri  
ðŸ”— [View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/)  
**Skill Focus:** C++ syntax, variables, loops, Raylib 2D games, object-oriented design

A gradual entry into C++ via Raylib, focusing on coding fundamentals through simple games like a reflex-based dodger, a runner, and a basic battle sim. The course guides students in writing clean, readable code and introduces object-oriented programming without relying on a full engine â€” making it ideal for understanding the raw logic behind game loops and entity behaviors.

### 4. Learn C++ Programming By Making Games
**Instructor:** Serge Lansiquot  
ðŸ”— [View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-cpp-by-making-games/)  
**Skill Focus:** C++ logic, pseudocode translation, ASCII-based game development

This project is designed around breaking problems into small logic units and translating them into code. The result is a series of text-based games with increasingly complex mechanics. Iâ€™ll be improving my ability to reason through game logic and implement it step-by-step using real-world coding techniques from a developer with AAA experience (Minecraft, Halo Infinite).

### 5. Learn C++ for Game Development
**Instructor:** Stephen Ulibarri  
ðŸ”— [View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-cpp-for-ue4-unit-1/)  
**Skill Focus:** Full C++ language foundation, whiteboard logic, lab-style programming

This course builds the theoretical and practical foundation for transitioning into engine-based development (e.g., Unreal). Emphasis is placed on understanding the C++ language from the ground up, with structured lab sessions simulating classroom-style coding practice and conceptual overviews.

---

### 6. Learn C++ Programming By Making Games Volume 2
**Instructor:** Serge Lansiquot  
ðŸ”— [View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-cpp-programming-by-making-games-volume-2/)  
**Skill Focus:** Advanced OOP, SDL graphics, 2D math and rendering, arcade game framework

An advanced C++ project involving the creation of a complete arcade launcher and game engine. You'll build rendering systems, sprite animations, and low-level mechanics to recreate classics like Tetris and Asteroids, with custom handling for bitmap loading, input, collision, and game loop timing.

### 7. Learn C++ and Make a Game from Scratch
**Instructor:** Jingtian Li  
ðŸ”— [View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-game-development-series-04-making-a-game-with-c/)  
**Skill Focus:** CMake, GitHub, game architecture, memory management, custom libraries

This course walks through making a game entirely from scratch using C++ with real-world tooling like Git and CMake. It blends software engineering practices with game development, teaching low-level architecture, project modularization, memory safety, and professional version control workflows â€” essential for industry readiness.

### 8. Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games
**Instructors:** Ben Tristem, GameDev.tv Team  
ðŸ”— [View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/)  
**Skill Focus:** Gameplay programming in Unreal Engine, AI behavior trees, Blueprints vs C++

A capstone project in Unreal Engine 5, focused on applying C++ in conjunction with Unrealâ€™s gameplay framework. Through projects like a tank combat game and a first-person shooter, Iâ€™ll be diving into pawn control, component systems, AI logic, and integrating Blueprints with native C++ for scalable, modular game logic â€” mirroring the workflows used in AAA development.
