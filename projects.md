# Project Experience

## Void Knights  
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Status:** In Development  

Void Knights is a third-person, 3D turn-based RPG project inspired by the *Persona* series, focusing on dual-world exploration, psychic abilities, and interactive storytelling. My programming work is centered on two core gameplay systems: 'Psychic Abilities' and 'Exploration & Interaction'.  

### Key Contributions  
- **Void Entrance Mechanic:** Developing a world-shifting mechanic allowing players to transition between *Reality* and the *Void Verse* to solve puzzles or reveal hidden paths.  
  - Environment dynamically shifts between worlds.  
  - Some objects or enemies may only exist in one realm, requiring strategic shifting.  
  - System is energy-based, preventing excessive use.  
- **Object Manipulation Mechanic:** Telekinesis-based object interaction with engine physics for environmental puzzles and combat.  
  - Players can lift, move, and throw objects with psychic abilities.  
  - Physics-based interactions ensure objects behave naturally.  
- **Exploration & Interactive World Systems:** Developing mechanics that enhance environmental interactions and puzzle-solving.  
  - Players interact with doors, switches, destructible barriers, and world elements.  
  - Some interactions change depending on the active world (Reality vs. Void Verse).  
  - Designed puzzles require players to shift between worlds for progression.  
- **NPC AI & Dialogue System:** Working on interactive NPCs with branching conversations and dynamic behaviors.  
  - NPCs follow set behaviors, patrols, and schedules.  
  - Dialogue system supports branching choices affecting interactions.  
  - Some NPCs provide quests, lore, and tracked narrative progression.  

Void Knights is currently in active development, with further refinements to AI, world interactions, and puzzle mechanics planned for future iterations.

## Mysteries of Tupni  
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Release:** Itch.io  

A fantastical third-person 3D action-adventure game where I was responsible for various programming tasks, concepting during preproduction, and assisting in level and game design.  

### Key Contributions  
- **Level design & environment setup:** Created and structured key game environments and interactive elements.  
- **Interactive objects:** Designed and scripted interactables with widget displays, doors, chests, and teleporting stones (level transfer).  
- **Inventory system:** Developed an interactive inventory system integrating:  
  - **Item data structures:** Created structured inventory with Unreal Engine Data Tables defining item properties.  
  - **UI integration:** Built inventory widgets supporting:  
    - **Drag-and-drop functionality** for moving items between slots.  
    - **Tooltips** for detailed item information.  
    - **Filtering and sorting** based on item types (weapons, consumables, quest items).  
    - **Persistent Inventory** across different game levels.  
  - **Item interaction mechanics:**  
    - Implemented item pickup logic using trace detection.  
    - Designed item usage logic for consumables, equippables, and stackable resources.  
    - Developed item dropping, spawning world objects upon inventory removal.  
- **Quest integration:** Structured objectives and NPC interactions to guide player progression.

## Ginger Shroom Journey  
**Platform:** Unity | **Language:** C# | **Release:** Steam  
A fully released 2D adventure game built in Unity. I was responsible for core gameplay programming, level design, UI implementation, and optimization. Key aspects included:
- **Character movement & physics:** Implemented smooth movement and collision handling.  
- **Interactable objects:** Developed event-driven interactions and environmental triggers.  
- **Patrolling Enemies:** Scripted movement logic and built edge detection collision logic.  
- **Game UI & Camera:** Created menus, HUD elements, and implemented a dynamic player state-driven camera.  
- **Steam integration:** Built a store page and handled publishing processes utilizing SteamworksSDK and SteamPipeGUI.
