# Project Experiences

## Projects

### Quantum Tether  
**Platform:** Unity | **Language:** C# | **Release:** Itch.io  

Quantum Tether is a 2D roguelike infinite sidescroller where you swing, dash, and thread your way through the accelerating currents of cosmic debris. Built around precise movement and rhythm-based momentum, the game features a fully functional upgrade system, collectible mechanics, and reactive environments.  

**Key Contributions**
- **Core Mechanics:** Designed and implemented the grappling and tethering system using vector-based physics, allowing players to swing dynamically between anchor points.  
- **Upgrade System:** Built a modular upgrade framework with 10+ abilities such as dash cooldown reduction, dual-thread grappling, extended range, and slowed camera speed for enhanced flow control.  
- **Procedural Anchor Patterns:** Created mathematical anchor point generation using parametric equations and sinusoidal patterns to vary level rhythm and challenge.  
- **UI & Menus:** Developed a responsive UI and main menu system with start, pause, and settings functionality. Added custom cursor integration and dynamic HUD elements.  
- **Game Loop & Progression:** Structured scoring, collectibles, and difficulty progression to encourage replayability and long-run mastery.  
- **Quality of Life & Polish:** Implemented gameplay pausing, camera zoom upgrades, and accessibility options/settings for a smoother experience.

- **Object Manipulation Mechanic:** Implemented telekinesis-based object interaction using engine physics for puzzles and combat.  
  - Players can lift, move, and throw objects with psychic abilities.  
  - Physics-based interactions use vector math and line traces for accurate targeting.  
- **Exploration & Interaction Systems:** Created mechanics that enhance world interactivity and puzzle-solving.  
  - Players interact with doors, switches, and other world elements.  
  - Certain puzzles require world-shifting for progression.  
- **NPC AI & Dialogue:** Built interactive NPCs with patrol behaviors and branching conversations.  
- **UI & Menus:** Developed logic and widgets for in-world menus and settings.  

Void Knights was a prototype/proof of concept developed by a small indie-level team of artists, designers, and programmers.

### Unnamed Project – 2D Renderer & Game Development with Odin & Sokol  
**Platform:** No Engine (Windows/WebGL/MacOS) | **Language:** Odin | **Status:** Postponed  

A deep dive into engine-free 2D game development using Odin and Sokol. Built atop Randy.gg’s minimalist 2D renderer, this project explores low-level graphics programming and game architecture from the ground up.  

**Focus Areas**
- Learning renderer internals and low-level graphics operations.  
- Expanding the base framework for improved input, animation, and gameplay logic.  
- Building modular, scalable systems without relying on traditional engines.  

**Future Plans**
- Add collision, physics, and animation from scratch.  
- Expand rendering capabilities with new visual effects.  
- Prototype a small but polished 2D game within this custom framework.  
- Optimize rendering and performance for efficiency and clarity.  

This project is both a learning experience and an exploration of complete engine autonomy—understanding every layer of what makes a game engine tick.
