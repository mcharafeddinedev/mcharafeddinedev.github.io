# Project Experiences

## Void Knights  
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Prototype:** Itch.io  

Void Knights is a third-person turn-based RPG project inspired by the *Persona* series, focusing on dual-world exploration, psychic abilities, and interactive storytelling. My programming work is centered on two core gameplay systems: 'Psychic Abilities' and 'Exploration & Interaction'.

### Key Contributions  
- **Void Entrance Mechanic:** Developing a world-shifting mechanic allowing players to transition between *Reality* and the *Void Verse* to solve puzzles or reveal hidden paths.  
  - Environment dynamically shifts between worlds.  
  - Some objects or enemies may only exist in one realm, requiring strategic shifting.  
- **Object Manipulation Mechanic:** Telekinesis-based object interaction with engine physics for environmental puzzles and combat.  
  - Players can lift, move, and throw objects with psychic abilities.  
  - Physics-based interactions using vector math and line traces ensure that targeted objects behave as intended.  
- **Exploration & Interactive World Systems:** Developing mechanics that enhance environmental interactions and puzzle-solving.  
  - Players interact with doors, switches, and other world elements.  
  - Some interactions change depending on the active world (Reality vs. Void Verse).  
  - Designed puzzles require players to shift between worlds for progression.  
- **NPC AI & Dialogue System:** Working on interactive NPCs with branching conversations.  
  - Some NPCs follow set behaviors and patrols in the Overworld.
- **UI & Menus:** Developed and implemented logic and widgets for menus and settings.
  - Built and implemented UI widgets for the Overworld (outside Combat) and related assets.

Void Knights was a prototype/proof of concept from a small indie studio level team of artists, designers, and programmers.

    - **Drag-and-drop functionality** for moving items between slots.  
    - **Tooltips** for detailed item information.  
    - **Filtering and sorting** based on item types (weapons, consumables, quest items).  
    - **Persistent Inventory** across different game levels.  
  - **Item interaction mechanics:**  
    - Implemented item pickup logic using trace detection.  
    - Designed item usage logic for consumables, equippables, and stackable resources.  
    - Developed item dropping, spawning world objects upon inventory removal.  
- **Quest integration:** Structured objectives and NPC interactions to guide player progression.

## Ginger Shroom Journey  
**Platform:** Unity | **Language:** C# | **Release:** Steam  
A fully released 2D adventure game built in Unity. I was responsible for core gameplay programming, level design, UI implementation, and optimization. Key aspects included:
- **Character movement & physics:** Implemented smooth movement and collision handling.  
- **Interactable objects:** Developed event-driven interactions and environmental triggers.  
- **Patrolling Enemies:** Scripted movement logic and built edge detection collision logic.  
- **Game UI & Camera:** Created menus, HUD elements, and implemented a dynamic player state-driven camera.  
- **Steam integration:** Built a store page and handled publishing processes utilizing SteamworksSDK and SteamPipeGUI.

## Unnamed Project
### **2D Renderer & Game Development with Odin & Sokol**  
**Platform:** No Engine - Windows/WebGL/MacOS | **Language:** Odin | **Status:** In Development   

This project is my deep dive into **engine-free 2D game development**, using the **Odin programming language** and **Sokol** for rendering. The foundation comes from **Randy.gg’s** 2D renderer, which provides a minimalist but powerful system for handling sprites, text, and basic transformations. My goal is to **understand, extend, and build on top of it** to create a game from scratch—without relying on traditional engines like Unity or Unreal.  

Right now, I’m focused on:  
- **Learning the inner workings of the 2D renderer** and how low-level graphics programming ties everything together.  
- **Expanding and modifying the framework** to better suit my game's development.  
- **Experimenting with gameplay mechanics**, input handling, and overall game structure.  
- **Keeping everything modular and efficient**, so it can scale well as a full project.  

Future Plans 
- Adding collision, physics, and animation from scratch.  
- Expanding the renderer’s capabilities with new visual effects.  
- Prototyping a small but polished 2D game inside this framework.  
- Optimizing rendering and performance for better efficiency.  

This is as much a learning experience as it is a passion project—building something without a game engine forces me to really understand and learn graphics programming, memory management, and game architecture at a lower level, and what kinds of processes go on behind the scenes in a game engine. The goal is to end up with a game project that not only plays well but is built with no engine and with full control over every system.
