### Quantum Tether  
**Unity | C# | Itch.io**

A 2D roguelike sidescroller built around precision movement, grappling physics, and momentum-based traversal.

**Highlights**
- Designed a **vector-based grappling/tether system** for dynamic swinging between anchor points.  
- Built a **modular upgrade framework** (10+ abilities: dash cooldowns, dual threads, range modifiers, camera control).  
- Implemented **procedural anchor generation** using parametric and sinusoidal math to vary level rhythm.  
- Developed responsive **UI, HUD, menus**, scoring, collectibles, and difficulty scaling.  
- Added polish: pausing, camera upgrades, accessibility options.
